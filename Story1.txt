-:0:You wake up in an unfamiliar room. Just like college, you can't find your phone and you are missing your pants. The only exits you can see are the door and the window. What do you check?:1A:Try the window. I ain't trying no doors.:1B:Check the door first, being I am a logical human being and not a savage
-:1A:You're on the third story. So this house has at least three stories, which is a lot nicer than some people in this room have. Maybe if I hadn't majored in communications- but I digress. Next to the window you see a drainpipe. You could try climbing down. Or, there's a tree planted close enough to where you are that you could grab a branch and get down that way.:2A:Try the drainpipe. Parkour!:2B:Inch down the tree, keeping a terrified death grip the entire way down
-:1B:The door creaks open. A desk lamp casts meagar illuminesence across a well decorated room. You find it to be a nice reminder that some people are able to afford nice decor. There are several paintings hung about the room. :3C: Investigate the paintings:2D: Investigate the desk
-:2A:You edge out of the window and grab the drainpipe. Unfortunately you seem to know nothing about home construction because the drain pipe breaks away under your weight and you crash to your undoubtedly gruesome death. :0:The end. Start again.:0:The end. Start again.
-:2B:After an embarrassingly long time, you make it to the ground. I suppose you think you should look around, don't you, you enterprising little amnesiac? Well, do you want to look around the house or the grounds?:3A:The house. I could find a phone, or a map, or food because I missed breakfast:3B:The grounds. I've seen too many horror movies to go back inside.
-:2D:There is a small brittle note lying on the desk. You begin reading the note to yourself, "To whomever finds this note, I must ask that great care be taken. There are many paths to take, while one will offer salvation the other begets a shapeless, boundless, deep. A place of loss immeasurable, void of light and presence. Great care must be taken." :3C: Investigate the paintings:3D: Take some great care
-:3A: You walk around the base until you find the front door. The house is wooden and tall, at least four stories. You'd say it had an impressive facade, if you were the type of pretentious douchebag who used words like "facade". Do you barge in like an idiot or try looking through a window to see if someone's in there? :4A:There's a window to the right. Four out of five dentists recommend that you check it.:4B:Barge in. For America.
-:3B:Outside there is a small garden, a mailbox standing in the middle of an empty field, and a strange outcropping of rocks. You briefly consider checking the rocks, but it occurs to you that it seems like a good place for snakes to live. Incidentally, you suddenly discover you have a crippling fear of snakes. So it looks like you can examine the garden or the mailbox. Which is it?:4C:Go to the mailbox.:4D:Go to the garden.
-:3C:A slow pace takes you around the room, examining each portrait as you pass. You stop, as a particular painting stands out against the rest. This painting is out of focus, while the others deliver rigid lines of sharp relief. :4E: Keep examinging the paintings in the room:5F: Move the painting
-:3D:Your head swells with pride as you assert yourself against the foreboding feeling of despair. You think to youself, "This isn't all that bad. It doesn't pay as much as my brother's job, as I am constantly reminded of by my wife. She can be such a bitch sometimes, always bringing up my brother. Like I am the opening act to my brother's great montrer, the Wiglaf to his Beowulf." Anyways, you die screaming in agony.:0:Sounds fair. :0:Sounds fair.
-:4A:The window is broken, which you just know is going to drive down the value of the entire creepy neighborhood. You look in to what looks like a washroom. I'd describe it for you, but my contract only requires I tell you things that move the story forward. Further inside you see a faint green glow is coming from another room. Something inside you is telling you that you must find the source of that light. Of course, that something could be a debilitating lack of self-preservation, but really, what else were you going to do today? I'm going to make you go in either way, so do you want to reach through the break and try the latch, or use a rock to break the rest of the window and climb in?:5A:I'll try and use the latch.  Give me a latch large enough and I can use a window...or something.:5B:Break the rest of the glass. I have unresolved issues from my childhood and like to express my feelings with small acts of violence.
-:4B:That's the spirit, I guess. You find yourself in a small kitchen. Plates of half-eaten food lie on the table. A cabinet door hangs half-open. It almost feels like a family had just vacated the space, except for the thick layer of dust covering every surface. An old rotary phone lies against the wall. This is making you feel very confident about your chances. If you like fatal optimism, you can try the phone anyway. Or, if you like fatal dying, you can can go through the next door further into the house. There's an eerie glow coming from under the crack, but I'm sure the it's a friendly sickly glow.:5C:Use the phone:5B:Go through the door
-:4C:What are we, in Zork? Can you really think of nothing more original than some action that is the basis of every other text-based adventure game? You know what? I'm killing you just on principle. Some sort of maniac comes out of the woods and kills you. That's right, there was a maniac. I'm taking poetic license. I'm the narrator. I can do whatever I want. Start from the beginning and think about what you've done.:0:That was uncalled for:0:That was uncalled for
-:4D:The garden is overrun with weeds, but a few hardy plants have managed to survive. You see some mint peeking through the scrub and pinch some off to pop it in your mouth. But it's not mint. It's a horribly poisonous plant your years as a Wilderness Scout should have prepared you for. You die alone in the garden just as you figure this whole mystery out, but I guess we'll never know now you pampered city scum.:0:The outdoors suck:0:The outdoors suck
-:4E:A slow pace takes you around the room, examining each portrait as you pass. You stop, it is the same painting noticed earlier. Nothing has changed, and you regret your decision to waste everyone's time. Time.... I could be doing a lot more with it. Instead, I took the path of least resistance. It is not like she hasn't been wasting MY time too. :5E:Examine the paintings again, but please don't:5F:Move the painting
-:5A:You cut your hand a little but you manage to raise the latch. You creep in and eventually manage to solve the mystery. But your cut also gave you tetanus and you die, so in the scheme of things it didn't seem as important anymore. And you leave your wife in crippling debt.:0:I guess I missed my shots:0:I guess I missed my shots
-:5B:You start slowly towards the door. Your hand trembles as you reach out to press gently on the rotted wood. This close, you can hear an ominous hum coming from inside the room as well. Mustering all your courage, you push the door firmly and stride in. Sitting in the middle of the room is a strange machine. It's the source of the light and the humming. Looking at its strage contours makes you feel ill, and suddenly you have to clutch the doorframe to stay standing. But something prevents your hip from slamming into the frame. You stick your hand in your pocket and find your phone. Oh, that's where you left it. You pull it out and are please to see it's still mostly charged. You call an Uber and make it home in time for dinner. I mean, it's seven years in the future and your life is a shambles, but it could have been worse.:0:Start again in an infinite hell-loop:0:Start again in an infinite hell-loop
-:5C:The line is dead. Of course. The homeowners probably use Comcast. You're too afraid to check the green light, so you just sit at the table and let your fate come to you.:0:My heart, like this phone, has lost reception:0:My heart, like this phone, has lost reception
-:5E:You begin to take another lap, but lose your balance and fall towards the painting. The painting moves, so fuck you, and a muffled click is heard behind the wall. A section of the wall shifts and reveals a dark hallway.:6A: Examine the paintings again, are you joking?:6B: Enter the hallway
-:5F:As you move the painting, you hear behind the wall a muffled clicking as if someone gently flicking some lonely fly upon the wall. Probably a latch and that is all. A section of the wall shifts and reveals a dark hallway.:6B: Enter the hallway. I'm not giving you a choice here. You make poor decisions when left to yourself.:6B: Enter the hallway. I'm not giving you a choice here. You make poor decisions when left to yourself.
-:6A: Again, you take a walk around the room. Spinning and shifting, your line of sight skews the room into terrible shapes. Another creak behind you and suddenly.........................................................................sorry, I'm back. Someone stabbed you for walking around the room again.:0:Art sucks:0:Art sucks
-:6B: A long hallway stretches itself before you. It is still dark, no surprise there as it has been dark the entire time. No need to reflect on how repetitive this scenario has become, everything is a copy of a copy anyways, history repeats itself. I said I would make better choices. Perhaps I could be more like my brother, since that would make everyone soooo damn happy. :7A: Open the door:7A: Knock on the door
-:7A:The door swings open to a small man sitting at a desk, feverishly typing away on some near obsolete piece of machinery. His hard work, all for naught. No songs  will be sung, no cheap accolades to be bestowed, all that he has is this moment. You recognize the man as the same man who stole money from you two nights ago, trust me... it happened. This man deserves a quick death. You reach into your pocket and find a knife, as if some invisible hand has been placing maliciousness into your pants... it is certainly not the first time. :8A: Kill the man:0: Go back to the window, that seems the safer route.:0: Go back to the window, that seems the safer route.
-:8A:You violently lunge at the man, displaying your most savage facial expression and with arms flailing, head twisted in a way that can only be described as awkward. The man in the chair is still typing. As the blade pierces his side, the man lets out a long, drawn out and high pitched, microwaved hotdog type of hiss. He doesn't die, but you and him both know that his injuries are enough to file a disability claim. Both of you understand that he no longer will need to work in his current position.
